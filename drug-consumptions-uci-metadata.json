Set Information:**\n\nDatabase contains records for 1885 respondents. For each respondent 12 attributes are known: Personality measurements which include NEO-FFI-R (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness), BIS-11 (impulsivity), and ImpSS (sensation seeking), level of education, age, gender, country of residence and ethnicity. All input attributes are originally categorical and are quantified. After quantification values of all input features can be considered as real-valued. In addition, participants were questioned concerning their use of 18 legal and illegal drugs (alcohol, amphetamines, amyl nitrite, benzodiazepine, cannabis, chocolate, cocaine, caffeine, crack, ecstasy, heroin, ketamine, legal highs, LSD, methadone, mushrooms, nicotine and volatile substance abuse and one fictitious drug (Semeron) which was introduced to identify over-claimers. For each drug they have to select one of the answers: never used the drug, used it over a decade ago, or in the last decade, year, month, week, or day.\nDatabase contains 18 classification problems. Each of independent label variables contains seven classes: \u0022Never Used\u0022, \u0022Used over a Decade Ago\u0022, \u0022Used in Last Decade\u0022, \u0022Used in Last Year\u0022, \u0022Used in Last Month\u0022, \u0022Used in Last Week\u0022, and \u0022Used in Last Day\u0022.\n\nProblem which can be solved:\n* Seven class classifications for each drug separately.\n* Problem can be transformed to binary classification by union of part of classes into one new class. For example, \u0022Never Used\u0022, \u0022Used over a Decade Ago\u0022 form class \u0022Non-user\u0022 and all other classes form class \u0022User\u0022.\n* The best binarization of classes for each attribute.\n* Evaluation of risk to be drug consumer for each drug.\n\nDetailed description of database and process of data quantification are presented in E.
